Usage
=====
``django-axes`` listens to signals from ``django.contrib.auth.signals`` to
log access attempts:

* ``user_logged_in``
* ``user_logged_out``
* ``user_login_failed``

You can also use ``django-axes`` with your own auth module, but you'll need
to ensure that it sends the correct signals in order for ``django-axes`` to
log the access attempts.

Quickstart
----------

Once ``axes`` is in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your project settings file,
you can login and logout of your application via the ``django.contrib.auth``
views. The access attempts will be logged and visible in the "Access Attempts"
secion of the admin app.

By default, django-axes will lock out repeated attempts from the same IP
address. You can allow this IP to attempt again by deleting the relevant
``AccessAttempt`` records in the admin.

You can also use the ``axes_reset`` and ``axes_reset_user`` management commands
using Django's ``manage.py``.

* ``manage.py axes_reset`` will reset all lockouts and access records.
* ``manage.py axes_reset ip`` will clear lockout/records for ip
* ``manage.py axes_reset_user username`` will clear lockout/records for an username

In your code, you can use ``from axes.utils import reset``.

* ``reset()`` will reset all lockouts and access records.
* ``reset(ip=ip)`` will clear lockout/records for ip
* ``reset(username=username)`` will clear lockout/records for a username

Example usage
-------------

Here is a more detailed example of sending the necessary signals using
`django-axes` and a custom auth backend at an endpoint that expects JSON
requests. The custom authentication can be swapped out with ``authenticate``
and ``login`` from ``django.contrib.auth``, but beware that those methods take
care of sending the nessary signals for you, and there is no need to duplicate
them as per the example.

*forms.py:* ::

    from django import forms

    class LoginForm(forms.Form):
        username = forms.CharField(max_length=128, required=True)
        password = forms.CharField(max_length=128, required=True)

            post_data = json.loads(request.body.decode('utf-8'))
            form = LoginForm(post_data)

                        'username': form.cleaned_data.get('username')

*urls.py:* ::

    from myapp.views import Login

    urlpatterns = [
        path('login/', Login.as_view(), name='login'),
    ]

Integration with django-allauth
-------------------------------

``axes`` relies on having login information stored under ``AXES_USERNAME_FORM_FIELD`` key
both in ``request.POST`` and in ``credentials`` dict passed to
``user_login_failed`` signal. This is not the case with ``allauth``.
``allauth`` always uses ``login`` key in post POST data but it becomes ``username``
key in ``credentials`` dict in signal handler.

To overcome this you need to use custom login form that duplicates the value
of ``username`` key under a ``login`` key in that dict
(and set ``AXES_USERNAME_FORM_FIELD = 'login'``).

You also need to decorate ``dispatch()`` and ``form_invalid()`` methods
of the ``allauth`` login view. By default ``axes`` is patching only the
``LoginView`` from ``django.contrib.auth`` app and with ``allauth`` you have to
do the patching of views yourself.

*settings.py:* ::

    AXES_USERNAME_FORM_FIELD = 'login'

*forms.py:* ::

    from allauth.account.forms import LoginForm

    class AllauthCompatLoginForm(LoginForm):
        def user_credentials(self):
            credentials = super(AllauthCompatLoginForm, self).user_credentials()
            credentials['login'] = credentials.get('email') or credentials.get('username')
            return credentials

*urls.py:* ::

    from allauth.account.views import LoginView
    from axes.decorators import axes_dispatch
    from axes.decorators import axes_form_invalid
    from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator

    from my_app.forms import AllauthCompatLoginForm

    LoginView.dispatch = method_decorator(axes_dispatch)(LoginView.dispatch)
    LoginView.form_invalid = method_decorator(axes_form_invalid)(LoginView.form_invalid)

    urlpatterns = [
        # ...
        url(r'^accounts/login/$', # Override allauth's default view with a patched view
            LoginView.as_view(form_class=AllauthCompatLoginForm),
            name="account_login"),
        url(r'^accounts/', include('allauth.urls')),
        # ...
    ]

Altering username before login
------------------------------

In special cases, you may have the need to modify the username that is
submitted before attempting to authenticate. For example, adding namespacing or
removing client-set prefixes. In these cases, ``axes`` needs to know how to make
these changes so that it can correctly identify the user without any form
cleaning or validation. This is where the ``AXES_USERNAME_CALLABLE`` setting
comes in. You can define how to make these modifications in a callable that
takes a request object and a credentials dictionary,
and provide that callable to ``axes`` via this setting.

For example, a function like this could take a post body with something like
``username='prefixed-username'`` and ``namespace=my_namespace`` and turn it
into ``my_namespace-username``:

*settings.py:* ::

    def sample_username_modifier(request):
        provided_username = request.POST.get('username')
        some_namespace = request.POST.get('namespace')
        return '-'.join([some_namespace, provided_username[9:]])

    AXES_USERNAME_CALLABLE = sample_username_modifier

    # New format that can also be used
    # the credentials argument is provided if the
    # function signature has two arguments instead of one

    def sample_username_modifier_credentials(request, credentials):
        provided_username = credentials.get('username')
        some_namespace = credentials.get('namespace')
        return '-'.join([some_namespace, provided_username[9:]])

    AXES_USERNAME_CALLABLE = sample_username_modifier_new

NOTE: You still have to make these modifications yourself before calling
authenticate. If you want to re-use the same function for consistency, that's
fine, but ``axes`` doesn't inject these changes into the authentication flow
for you.
