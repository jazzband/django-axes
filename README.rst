Axes is a very simple way for you to keep track of failed
login attempts for your login and administration views.

The name is sort of a geeky pun, since it can be interpreted as:

* ``access``, as in monitoring access attempts, or
* ``axes``, as in tools you can use to hack (generally on wood).

In this case, however, the hacking part of it can be taken a bit further:
**Axes is intended to help you stop people from hacking your website**.


Functionality
-------------

Axes records login attempts to your Django powered site and prevents attackers
from brute forcing the site when they exceed the configured attempt limit.

Axes can track the attempts and persist them in the database indefinitely,
or alternatively use a fast and DDoS resistant cache implementation.

Axes can be configured to monitor login attempts by
IP address, username, user agent, or their combinations.

Axes supports cool off periods, IP address whitelisting and blacklisting,
user account whitelisting, and other features for Django access management.
